# ml algorithims from scratch (work in progress)

implementing some ml algorithms from linear regression to llms using only numpy. no sklearn, no pytorch, no tensorflow. 

## why?
- to understand ml algorithms from the ground up

## what's in here? (to come)
✅ linear regression (least squares, gradient descent)  
✅ logistic regression  
✅ naive bayes  
✅ knn (vectorized numpy implementation)  
✅ decision trees (gini, entropy, recursive splits)  
✅ random forests  
✅ svm (hinge loss, kernels)  
✅ neural networks (forward and backward propagation)  
✅ cnns (filters, pooling, convolutions)  
✅ rnns & lstms (sequence modeling)  
✅ transformers (self-attention, training from scratch)  
✅ llms (building and training basic models)  

## how to run
```bash
pip install numpy
cd something
python main.py
```
